           SUMMARY
        </h2>
        <p>
          After managing Products like the NA McDonald's  Mobile App, I decide that it is finally time to create my own business. With the help of 4 ex-colleagues, i founded S-HEalth, a Mobile app focused on women's health that was sold for $12.5M in 2020. Before i retrire , i am looking for a cause that i can contribute to with my product Management skills.
